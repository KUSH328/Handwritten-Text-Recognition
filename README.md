# Handwritten-Text-Recognition
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a technology that uses machine learning algorithms to convert written or hand-drawn text into digital text. This technology is used in a variety of applications, such as handwriting recognition for digital devices, handwriting-to-text conversion for document scanning, and signature recognition for secure electronic transactions.

HTR systems typically involve several stages, including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and recognition. Preprocessing may involve image enhancement, deskewing, and binarization, to prepare the image for further analysis. Segmentation is the process of dividing the image into individual characters or words. Feature extraction involves identifying and extracting relevant features of the image, such as the shape, size, and position of the characters. Recognition is the final stage, where the system compares the extracted features to those in a reference database and makes a prediction of the character or word.

HTR technology is constantly improving, with advances in machine learning techniques such as deep learning and neural networks, which have led to significant improvements in recognition accuracy.
